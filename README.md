# analytics

This is a personal SQL project created as part of my transition into data analytics.  
The database is fictional and built from scratch using SQLite in DBeaver, inspired by a typical company structure with employees, branches, clients, and sales.

The goal was to create a small, realistic structure that I can analyze end-to-end.

In Excel, I explored what a company would want to know from this data. 
I calculated different queries, for example sales by branch, found the top employee by sales with a Pivot Table, and flagged potential issues like a branch with no sales, checked and calculated ROI per employee. Then I made simple KPI views and quick charts.

In Tableau, I wrapped everything into one interactive dashboard. You can see KPIs, sales by branch, top employee, employees without sales, and an ROI view.
