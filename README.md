# analytics-sql

This is a personal SQL project created as part of my transition into data analytics.  
The database is fictional and built from scratch using SQLite in DBeaver, inspired by a typical company structure with employees, branches, clients, and sales.

The goal of the project was to simulate a small company database and practice analytical SQL queries, with a focus on:

- Understanding organizational structure (employees, supervisors, branches)
- Exploring employee data (age, salary, managers)
- Analyzing branch performance and employee distribution
